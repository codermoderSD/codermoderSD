### Heyy!👋🏻 I'm Shubham.

I am an Electronics Graduate from Vidyalankar Institute of Technology, Mumbai. Experimenting with different technologies is one of my favorite things to do. With the help of React and Firebase, I have created a couple of full-stack web apps. My goal is to gain a better understanding of backend technologies such as Node.js and Golang, as well as front-end code optimization. Front-end frameworks like Next.js are my preferred choices at the moment. There are so many things I'm fascinated by when it comes to IoT and Augmented Reality. I enjoy reading articles about the latest IoT trends and AR experiments during my spare time.

Some of my favorite things are:

- 🎹 Playing Piano and Flute 🎶
- 🔌 Tinkering with electronics
- 🏔 Trekking
- 🧐 Learning new things!
